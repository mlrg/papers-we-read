# Papers we Read
Collection of papers and write ups of research papers discussed in our meetings.

We shall have weekly meetings wherein we would discuss a paper or two and keep on maintaining an archive of the past meetings as well. There are few fundamental papers worth reading before starting anything specific in DL. One can simply follow this list category wise, which inherently serves as a roadmap.
